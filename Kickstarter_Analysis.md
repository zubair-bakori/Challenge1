# Fever by Louise Montana

## Overview of Project
    Louise Montana plans to stage her play named *Fever* sometime in the new year and she wishes to launch a fundraising campaign from the general public.  

### Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise determine the best times in the year for fundraising towards her project and the Dollar goals to set in order to achieve best outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
    The analysis was carried out using using MS-Excel tools to comb through the Kickstarter data set. I created Pivot tables and charts using various criteria to highlight outcomes based on launch dates and target donations. I encountered challenges while using the COUNTIFS() formula and drawing the line chart. I had consistently missed out certain ranges and criteria until I figured it out after asking a teaching assisstant and re-watching the video imbedded in the module. In the case of the line chart, five lines seemed to merge in an awkward form. It some time for me to delete all except the two lines that represent the successful and failed outcomes I require. I had also omitted to filter one of the columns, I figured this out too after carefully re-reading the relevant portion of the Challenge. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Based on the launch date the best outcomes are between March and August with a peak in the summer. The months of September and December are the lowest. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    The best goals would be to target donations below $15,000- and within the range $35,000-$45,000-.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
    My conclusion is that Louise's campaign should be between March and August. Similarly, she should be conservative and expect most donations to fall below $15,000-. If she wishes to aspire higher amounts she could, in the range $35,000- to $45,000-.
    
    Some of the limitations of this data set are that the outcomes are imprecise and could be affected by location and other contextual factors
